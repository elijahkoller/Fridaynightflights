                <p>FNF started as just 4 guys hanging out who wanted to have some fun with their new dart board on a friday night. That first almost unofficial event sparked many ideas, but one held strong. Aweekly event, a get together of friends, where they'd invite new faces and old. This was given a name: Friday Night Flights
<br><br>
Friday Night Flights quickly became more than just throwing darts and killing time. What started casual turned competitive fast. Bragging rights entered the room, then nicknames, then records—because of course someone had to start keeping score. Each Friday built on the last, and before anyone really noticed, patterns formed. Rivalries. Upsets. The quiet guy who suddenly couldn’t miss. The loud one who talked endless shit and somehow backed it up.
<br><br>
Rules came next—not because anyone wanted structure, but because chaos demanded it. Formats were tested, tweaked, broken, and rebuilt. Games ran late into the night, fueled by cheap drinks, bad decisions, and an obsession with being just a little better than the guy standing next to you. Winning mattered. Losing mattered more. You didn’t forget a bad night at FNF—you wore it until the next Friday.
<br><br>
Word spread the only way it ever does when something’s actually worth a damn. Friends brought friends. New faces walked in not knowing what they’d signed up for, and some never came back. Others got hooked immediately. By the end of the first season, Friday Night Flights wasn’t just a hangout—it was an event. Something you showed up early for. Something you talked about all week. Something you planned around.
<br><br>
And whether anyone realized it or not, FNF had crossed the line from “just four guys with a dartboard” into something that had its own gravity. A weekly proving ground. A place where legends were exaggerated, excuses were immortalized, and every Friday reset the scoreboard—but never the memory.
<br><br>
What began as nothing special had become unavoidable. And it was only getting started.</p>
