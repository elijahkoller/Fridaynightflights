    <h3>Silksong/h3>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IfW4ORO.png" alt="Mariner Profile"><p>
Hometown: Buenos Aires, Argentina
<br>Gimmick: The Bullshot Virtuoso
<br>Record: 2× FNF Champion (FNF 5, FNF 7 – Doubles)
<br><br>
Silksong isn’t just named after a video game — the man lives it. Breathes it. Plays that shit every damn day like it’s a religion and he’s the last moth-winged prophet left on Earth. When he steps up to the oche, he moves with that same jittery precision: elegant, twitchy, artistic, and occasionally one bad input away from disaster.
<br><br>
But when it comes to bullshots?<br>
Holy hell — this dude transforms.<br>
He doesn’t hit the bullseye. He obliterates it. It’s his entire identity, his one god-tier stat, the thing that makes grown competitors groan because they know the center of the board is about to get violated again. Everywhere else he’s just… fine. Average. Middling. Whatever. But his bullshot game is so freakishly elite it’s carried him to two titles — a solo championship in FNF 5 and a victory in the chaotic doubles madness of FNF 7.
<br><br>
Silksong represents Buenos Aires with pride, swagger, and that weird, vaguely cryptic rumor that he once “diddled a diddy in the dark.” No one knows what the hell it means. Everyone pretends they don’t want to know. But it follows him like a mischievous shadow.
<br><br>
Off the board, he’s an alt-music fiend. Foo Fighters tattoo? Of course he has one. Cherry Coke Zero? Goes through cans of that shit like it's water. Vibes? Immaculate.
And in the history books, Silksong holds a unique honor:
the first openly gay competitor to lose a Friday Night Flights match.
He embraced it. Bragged about it. Told everyone it was “camp as hell.” And honestly? It kind of was.
<br><br>
Silksong is wildly talented, strangely mysterious, occasionally average, but always unforgettable — a darting enigma wrapped in style, rhythm, bullshots, and pure Argentine chaos.
