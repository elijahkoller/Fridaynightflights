    <h3>The Mariner</h3>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/acqS1bJ.png" alt="Mariner Profile"><p>Hometown: Seattle, WA
<br>Gimmick: The Ruthless Naval Nightmare
<br>Record: 3× FNF Champion (FNF 2, FNF 3, FNF 9)
<br>
<br>When the waves first parted and The Mariner stomped onto the Friday Night Flights stage, everyone thought, “Oh cool, a sailor guy.” Then he immediately torpedoed the entire roster and made it crystal-fucking-clear he wasn’t here to make friends — he was here to dominate.
<br>
<br>He didn’t just win FNF 2 and 3. He obliterated the poor bastards who dared stand across from him. For a moment, the whole league damn near crowned him the final boss of darts wrestling — the storm no one could survive.
<br>
<br>And then that swine-summoned freak John Pork washed up and stole the spotlight, surpassing him with four FNF wins while The Mariner spiraled into a five-event drought. Five straight FNFs without a final. Five. For a man who treats losing like mutiny, it was hell.
<br>
<br>But real villains don’t stay down — they reload.
<br>
<br>At FNF 9, The Mariner stormed back with the fury of the Pacific itself, dragging John Pork into open water and drowning him 5–1 in the final in one of the most dominant championship performances the league has ever seen. The hat stayed on. The stare stayed murderous. The crowd damn near evacuated.
<br>
<br>Now? He’s back in the hunt. Unpredictable. Unforgiving. Unfazed by the boos. The Mariner fights like a man who’s survived storms way bigger than any opponent — because he has.
<br>
<br>And every Friday Night Flights, he answers the same question with the same cold glare:
<br>
<br>“Who dares test the tide tonight?”</p>
